In this book, the first of its kind written by a scientific expert, Professor Matthew Walker explores twenty years of cutting-edge research to solve the mystery of why sleep matters. Looking at creatures from across the animal kingdom as well as major human studies, Why We Sleepdelves in to everything from what really happens in our brains and bodies when we dream to how caffeine and alcohol affect sleep and why our sleep patterns change across a lifetime, transforming our appreciation of the extraordinary phenomenon that safeguards our existence.","link":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Why_We_Sleep.html?hl=&id=mIh4swEACAAJ","preview_link":"http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mIh4swEACAAJ&dq=why+we+sleep&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=2&source=gbs_api","tag":"book","dg-publish":true,"banner":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mIh4swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","permalink":"/books/why-we-sleep-matthew-walker/","dgPassFrontmatter":true}

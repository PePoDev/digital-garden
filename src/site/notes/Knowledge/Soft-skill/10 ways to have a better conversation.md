> Summary of TED Talk by ...

1. Don't multitask - Be present with the mind
2. Don't pontificate- Enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. Don't just try to get your point across. Everybody is an expert in something.
3. Use open-ended questions- Who, what, when, where, why, and how.
4. Go with the flow- Thoughts will come into your mind and go out of your mind. Let them go. Don't think for two minutes about a clever question to ask.
5. If you don't know say that you don't know.
6. Don't equate your experience with theirs- It is never the same. It's not about you. Don't take that moment. Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
7. Try not to repeat yourself.
8. Stay out of the weeds- People don't care about the years, the names, the dates all those details that you are struggling to come up with in your mind. They care about you.
9. Listen- Buddha said: If your mouth is open you're not learning. And Calvin Coolidge said: No man ever listened to his way out of a job. We don't listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.
10. Be brief- A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.

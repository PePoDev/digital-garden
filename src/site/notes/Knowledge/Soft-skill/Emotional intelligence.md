## Why EQ is Better for Business
The research shows only 15% of financial success is from technical ability. This means most of the company focus on high EQ better than high IQ
> Increase IQ is no impact, EQ is better for metrics for the success of work.

> Breadberry says, “*You can be a top performer without emotional intelligence, but the chances are slim.*”

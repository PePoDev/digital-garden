## Agile four values
- Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- Working software over the comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
## Agile Principals
1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery** – Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
2. **Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process** – The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
3. **Frequent delivery of working software** – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
4. **Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project** – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
5. **Support, trust, and motivate the people involved** – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
6. **Enable face-to-face interactions** – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress** – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
8. **Agile processes to support a consistent development pace** – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
9. **Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility** – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
10. **Simplicity** – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
11. **Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs** – Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
12. **Regular reflections on how to become more effective** – Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.

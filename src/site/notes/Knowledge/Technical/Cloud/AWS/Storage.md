## S3
- Use cases
	- Backup
	- Disaster Recovery
	- Archive
	- Hybrid Cloud Storage
	- Application hosting
	- Media hosting
	- Data lakes & big data analytics
	- Software delivery
	- Static website
- Globally unique name
- Looks like a global service but is created in a region
- Naming
	- No uppercase, No underscore
	- 3-63 characters long
	- Not an IP
	- Must start with a lowercase letter or number
	- Must NOT start with the prefix `xn--`
	- Must NOT start with the suffix `-s3alias`
- Objects
	- Key (Prefix + Object name)
	- There's no concept of the directory within buckets (the UI will trick you think)
	- Max object size is 5TB
	- If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
- Versioning
	- Protect against unintended deletes
	- The same key overwrite will change the version
	- Enabled at the bucket level
	- Suspending versioning does not delete the previous version
- Metadata
- Tags
- High durability 99.999999999% (11 9's) of objects across multiple AZ
- Classes
	- Standard - General Purpose
	- Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
	- One Zone-Infrequent Access
	- Glacier Instant Retrieval
	- Glacier Flexible Retrieval
	- Glacier Flexible Retrieval
	- Glacier Deep Archive
	- Intelligent Tiering
- Security
	- User-based
		- IAM Policies - Allow for a specific user from IAM
	- Resource-Based
		- Bucket Policies - Bucket-wide rules from the s3 console (allow cross-account)
		- Object ACL - finer grain (can be disabled)
		- Bucket ACL - less common (can be disabled)
	- IAM can access an s3 object if (The user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy allows it) AND there's no explicit deny
	- Encrypt objects in S3 using KMS
- Replication
	- Must enable versioning
	- Cross-Region Replication (CRR) - Compliance, Lower latency access
	- Same-Region Replication (SRR) - Log aggregation, Live replication between production and test accounts
	- The buckets can be in different AWS accounts
	- Must give proper IAM permission to S3
	- Only new objects are replicated when enabling replication
		- Use S3 Batch Replication for existing objects
		- For DELETE operations will replicate delete markers (need to enable)
		- Delete with version ID are not replicated (avoid malicious deletes)
		- There is no "chaining" of replication
## EBS
- Elastic Block Store is a network drive
- Can mount only one instance at a time
- Bound to a specific AZ
- Type
	- gp2 / gp3 (SSD): general purpose, 1GiB - 16 TiB
	- io1 / io2 (SSD): highest-performance, 4GiB - 16 TiB
		- Support multi-attach in the same AZ up to 16 instances at a time
	- st1 (HDD): low cost, 125GiB - 16 TiB
	- sc1 (HDD): lowest cost, 125GiB - 16 TiB
- Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes
- Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
- All the data in flight moves between the instance and the volume is encrypted
- All snapshots are encrypted
- Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
### Snapshot
- Make a backup at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach the volume to do a snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region
### Snapshot Archive
- Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
- 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
### Recycle Bin
- Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
- Specific retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
### Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
- Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use (\$\$\$)
## Instance Store
- High-performance hardware disk
- Better I/O performance
- Ephemeral, Lose when stopping the instance
- Good for the buffer, cache, scratch data / temporary content
- Backup and Replication are your responsibility
## EFS
- Managed NFS that can mount on many EC2
- Work with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use
- Use NFSv4.1 protocol
- Use a security group to control access
- Compatible with Linux-based AMI
- Modes
	- Performance Mode
		- General Purpose (default)
		- Max I/O: higher latency, throughput, highly parallel
	- Throughput Mode
		- Bursting: 1 TB = 50 MiB/s + burst of up to 100 MiB/s
		- Provisioned: set your throughput regardless of storage size
		- Elastic: automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workload
			- Up to 3 GiB/s for reads and 1 GiB/s for writes
- Storage Tiers
	- Standard: frequently accessed files
	- Infrequent access (IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
- Availability and durability
	- Standard: Multi-AZ
	- One zone: One AZ, Backup enabled by default, compatible with IA, 90% cost saving
- Lifecycle Policy: move files between storage tier
- File system policy: Control the access permission in EFS
## RDS
- Stands for Relational Database Service and It managed by AWS
- Supports Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MSSQL, Aurora (AWS Proprietary)
- Automated provisioning, OS patching
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamps (PTO)
- Monitoring dashboard
- Read replicas for improved read performance
	- Up to 15 Read replicas
	- Within AZ, Cross AZ, or Cross Region
	- Replication is Async, So reads are eventually consistent
	- Can be promoted
- Multi-AZ setup for DR (disaster Recovery), Sync replication, One DNS name, and automatic app failover to standby
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
- Backup
	- Automated backup
		- Daily full backup during the backup window
		- Transaction logs backup every 5 minutes
		- 1 - 35 days of retention (set to 0 to disable)
	- Manual snapshot
		- Retention as long as you want
- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
	- Auto-scaling for storage
- Network cost: Normally network costs when data goes from one AZ to another, but RDS read replicas within the same region are FREE! ![Storage-2023-05-14.png](/img/user/Attachments/Storage-2023-05-14.png)
- Can't SSH into the instance
- RDS Custom: Managed Oracle and MSSQL can access the underlying database and OS
- Restore
	- from snapshot
	- from S3 backup by Percona XtraBackup
	- Clone from existing one
		- Use copy-on-write protocol
			- Initial the new DB uses the same data volume (no copying is needed)
			- When updates are made to the new DB then additional storage is allocated and data is copied to be separated
		- fast & cost-effective
		- Useful for creating staging DB from production without impact on production DB
- Security
	- At-rest Encryption by KMS
	- In-flight encryption is enabled by default use with the AWS TLS root certificates client-side
	- If the master is not encrypted, the replicas can't be encrypted
	- To encrypt an un-encrypted DB, snapshot and restore as encrypted
	- Audit logs can be enabled
- Proxy
	- Pool and share FB connections established with the database
	- Improving database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources and minimizing open connections (and timeouts)
	- Serverless, Autoscaling, HA (multi AZ)
	- Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up to 66%
	- No code changes are required for most apps
	- Enforce IAM Authentication for DB and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
	- RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)
### Aurora
- A proprietary database from AWS supports Postgres and MySQL
- Aurora is "AWS cloud-optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB up to 128 TB
- One Aurora Instance tasks write (master)
- Up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous (less than 30 seconds), native HA
- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ
	- 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
	- 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
	- Self-healing with P2P replication
	- Storage is striped across 100s of volumes![Storage-2023-05-14-2.png](/img/user/Attachments/Storage-2023-05-14-2.png)
- Support Cross Region Replication
- Cost more than RDS around 20%
- Aurora Multi-Master: Immediate failover for write node (HA)![Storage-2023-05-14-6.png](/img/user/Attachments/Storage-2023-05-14-6.png)
- Serverless
	- Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling
	- No capacity planning needed
	- Pay per second can be more cost-effective![Storage-2023-05-14-5.png](/img/user/Attachments/Storage-2023-05-14-5.png)

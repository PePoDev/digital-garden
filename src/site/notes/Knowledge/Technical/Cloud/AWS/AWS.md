- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example: 
	- ap-southeast-2a
	- ap-southeast-2b
	- ap-southeast-2c
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- Theyâ€™re separate from each other, so that theyâ€™re isolated from disasters
- Theyâ€™re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

## IAM: Users & Groups
- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and users can belong to multiple groups

Created when a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity account creates a Google Cloud Project
## Resource hierarchy
Itâ€™s important to understand this resource hierarchy because it directly relates to how policies are managed and applied when you use Google Cloud.
- Organization node (Level 04)
	- Folder (Level 03)
		- Project (Level 02)
			- Resource (Level 01)

> Policies are also inherited downward. This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder.

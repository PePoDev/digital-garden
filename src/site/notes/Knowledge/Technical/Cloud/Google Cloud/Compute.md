### Managed Instance Groups
- Deploy identical instances based on the instance template
- The instance group can be resized
- The manager ensures all instances are RUNNING
- Typically used with autoscaler
- Can be a single zone or regional
- Rolling update without service disruption
## GKE
- Fully managed Kubernetes
- Container-Optimized OS
- Auto upgrade
- Auto repair unhealthy node
- Cluster autoscaling
- Seamless integration with Cloud Build and Container Registry
- Identity and access management
- Integrated logging and monitoring with Google Cloud Operation Suite
- Integrated networking with VPC features
- Cloud Console can view, inspect, and delete the resources
- Stream log to Cloud Logging by default
- Node-level logging that is older than 1 day or reaches 100 Mb will be compressed and rotated
- Binary authorization allows you to enforce deployment of only trusted containers into GKE
- Number of nodes per region
- Mode
	- Standard
		- Pay per resources provisioned
		- User configured resources
		- User Configured autoscaling
		- Regional or zonal
	- Autopilot
		- Google manages nodes and pools
		- Provision based on pod specification
		- Pay per pod, only resources used
		- Built-in security best practices
		- Regional
### Node Auto Provisioning (NAP)
- Adds new node pools sized to meet demand
- Without node auto-provisioning, the cluster autoscaler will only create new nodes in the node pools you specified, meaning the new nodes will be the same machine type as the other nodes in that pool
- This is perfect for helping optimize resource usage for batch workloads and other apps that don't need extreme scaling
- Creating a node pool specifically optimized for your use case might take more time than just adding more nodes to an existing pool
### Network policy
- Requirements
	- Have at least 2 nodes
	- The node must restart when to enable
	- All nodes must be of machine type `n1-standard-1` or higher
### Double-Hop problem
![Compute-2023-04-24-8.png](/img/user/Attachments/Compute-2023-04-24-8.png)
- Set `externalTrafficPolicy: local` in the service manifest to force the `kube-proxy` to choose a Pod on the receiving node for the lowest latency
### Container-native load balancer
- eliminates the "Local" external-traffic policy workaround
- Leverages a Google Cloud HTTP(S) load balancer
- Traffic is directed to the Pods directly instead of to the nodes
- Use a data model called Network Endpoint Groups
![Compute-2023-04-24-9.png](/img/user/Attachments/Compute-2023-04-24-9.png)
### Workload Identity
- Access Google Cloud services in a secure and manageable way
- Workload Identity allows a Kubernetes service account in your GKE cluster to act as an IAM service account
- Pods that use the configured Kubernetes service account automatically authenticate as the IAM service account when accessing Google Cloud APIs
## App Engine

## Cloud Run
- A managed-to-compute platform that can run the stateless containers
- Serverless, removing the need for infrastructure management
- Built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment built on Kubernetes
- Automatically scale up and down from zero almost instantaneously charging only for the resources used
- Pay-per-use
- Up to 1000 container instances by default
- Manage identities that can access service or allow unauthorized access
- Containers isolated to gVisor sandbox
- Container instance can receive up to 80 requests at the same time (1,000 max)
- Possible to reduce concurrency to 1
## Cloud Function
- Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events, without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment
- Charges apply only when your code runs
- Automatic scaling with highly available and fault-tolerant design
- Triggered based on events in Google Cloud services, HTTP endpoints, and Firebase
- Receive 1 request at a time
- Trigger types
	- HTTP
	- Cloud Storage
	- Cloud Pub/Sub
	- Cloud Firestore
	- Firebase
	- Cloud Logging
- No internet access by default
- Best practices
	- Correctness
		- Write idempotent functions
		- Send HTTP response in HTTP functions
		- Do not start background operations
		- Clean up temporary files
		- Do not manually exit, e.g. do not use `sys.exit()` in Python
	- Performance
		- Balance the use of imports with performance
		- Use global variables to reuse variables across invocations
		- Use lazy initialization on global variables
- Generation
	- V1
		- 1 concurrent request per function instance
		- Up to 8 GB with 2 vCPU
		- Support 4 event types
	- V2
		- Build on top of Cloud Run and Eventarc

		- Request timeout up to 60 minutes for HTTP triggered
		- Up to 16 GiB with 4 vCPU
		- Up to 1000 concurrent per function instance
		- Support Multiple Function Revisions and Traffic Splitting
		- Support for 90+ event types
- Typical serverless functions architecture
	- Autoscaling as new invocations com in
	- One function instance handles ONLY ONE request at a time
	- Cold Start
		- Solution - Configure Min number of instances (increases cost)
## Pub/Sub
- The publisher sends a message to Topic
- Message individually delivered to each and every subscription
- Subscribers can receive messages either by push and pull
- Add Dataflow into flow to enable message deduplication (exactly-once processing)

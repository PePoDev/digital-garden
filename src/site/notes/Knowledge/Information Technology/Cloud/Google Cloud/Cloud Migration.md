## Migrate for Compute Engine (MFCE)
- MFCE 4
	- For Azure, AWS
- MFCE 5
	- offer a simpler and more powerful way of migrating VMWare (only)
	- Managed service, No longer needs to deploy by Google Marketplace
	- done by using replication, not streaming
	- No more Cloud Extension/edge nodes
	- No agent is needed on the migrated VMs (agentless migration)
	- Minimum connectivity requirements (can be performed over HTTPS 443)
	- Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect is no longer required (but still supported)
- Process
	- Setup VPN + Network tags
	- Create GCP roles and service accounts
	- Deploy migrate for Compute Engine Manager
	- Configure source environment
	- Deploy Cloud Extension
- Test clone only available for 1 copy per instance at a time
- Offline migration
	- Enables you to migrate workloads with the (typically) legacy operating systems that are not currently supported by Migrate for Compute Engine
	- Can also be used for "storage-only migration"
	- Steps
		- Source VM shutdown
		- Storage migrates completely to Cloud Extension
		- Storage is being detached from Cloud Extension to Persistent Disk
		- Migrated VM starts at GCP
- Migration wave
	- Components
		- Wave -  A construct for batch migration of VMs
		- Runbook - The spec file describing the source VM in the wave along with the Target specification per each VM
		- Wave job - Migration jobs ( Test clone,  Full Migration, Detach, Cleanup)
	- Choosing
		- Business Criticality
		- Lifecycle Environment
		- Uptime Sensitivity
		- Licensing and Compliance
		- Dependencies
